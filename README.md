# Own-prorgamming-language
`Making my own "programming language" interpreter in C`

This is on its early stages since it has been created in 2 days, so expect it to be poorly written by now.

There's the interpreter on [Interpreter.c](https://github.com/DeetSteve00/Own-prorgamming-language/blob/main/Interpreter.c "INTERPRETER.C")
There's also a guide on the language itself on [Guide.txt](https://github.com/DeetSteve00/Own-prorgamming-language/blob/main/Guide.txt "GUIDE.TXT").

`Requirements`:
```
- Being on a Windows OS
- Having a compiler that supports getch(); (Preferly, GCC)
```
