# Own-prorgamming-language
Making my own "programming language" in C

There's the interpreter on [Interpreter.c](https://github.com/DeetSteve00/Own-prorgamming-language/blob/main/Interpreter.c "INTERPRETER.C")
There's also a guide on the language itself on [Guide.txt](https://github.com/DeetSteve00/Own-prorgamming-language/blob/main/Guide.txt "GUIDE.TXT").

`Requirements`:
```
- Being on a Windows OS
- Having a compiler that supports getch(); (Preferly, MinGW GCC)
- Basic knowledge of the command prompt (cmd.exe)
```

**To-do list:**
  - Add every Syntax error possible **(DONE)**
  - Add aritmethic operators **(Must add all)**
  - If-else statements
  - **"Clean"** the interpreter's code *(It looks like this will be on to-do list forever)*
  - Fix the comments issue **(DONE)**
