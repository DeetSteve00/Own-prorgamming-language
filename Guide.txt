! How to run:
!	You must first open command prompt (Assuming you're using Windows, since the interpreter doesn't work on any other OS)
!	Then, you must go to the directory where the interpreter is or set your path to its location
!	Now type in the command prompt: "(Filename of interpreter) (File path to program)" (File extension doesn't matter, the interpreter assumes its a text document)
!	You can also test the functions using: "(Filename of interpreter) con" (Crtl + C to exit this mode)
!	The results must appear in the console after running program.

! Syntax:
!	VAR: Define a variable, instead of names, use numbers to reference them
!	INP: Input a number and save it to a variable
!	OUT: Print stuff, use a number to reference a variable, or use the " " to output a string
! SET: Command to set target variable as the result of an operation.
!	NLN: New line
!	END: End the program
! To make a comment, use '!' to set everything at it's right as a comment until the end of the line.
! There must be no spacing between the beggining of the line and the function called
! There are a maximum of 300 variables


! HelloWorld with line break example:
!	OUT "Hello World!"
!	NLN

! Variables example:
!	VAR 1 10 !Set the variable #1 to 10
!	VAR 7 12 !Set the variable #7 to 12
!
!	OUT "Variable #1 is: "
!	OUT 1 !Output the variable #1's value
!	NLN
!	OUT "While the variable #7 is: " 
!	OUT 7	!Output variable #7's value

! Input example:
!	VAR 14 123 !Set variable #14 to 123
!	OUT "Variable #14 is: "
!	OUT 14
!	NLN
!	INP 14 !Input the console a number, and save it on variable #14+
!	NLN
!	OUT "Now, the variable #1 is: "
!	OUT 14

! Operations example:
! OUT "Number #1: "
! INP 1
! OUT "Number #2: "
! INP 2
! SET+ 1 2 !(This sums the value of variable #1 & #2 and stores the relust on variable #1), the symbol right after SET is the operation.
! OUT "Result of sum: "
! OUT 1
